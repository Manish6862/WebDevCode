    <p align="justify">According to Tech Jury, despite a number of cool apps and tips for successful time management, only 17% of people track their time. 50% of people have never thought about time waste, even though they are always late and running out of time. Time management is a skill. It helps people handle their daily duties without burnout and severe exhaustion. The N.I.L.C. includes time management on the list of top ten demanded soft skills that employees require in 2022. Why is it so important to manage one’s time correctly? Stephen Covey once said, “The key is not spending time, but in investing it”. It means that proper timing guarantees a person’s success in many life areas.
        Career Trend names three negative aspects that occur when a person is not able to follow a schedule and be flexible. First off, one risks delaying the task performance all the time. People who got used to procrastination start doing assignments and duties at the very last moment. As a result, they sacrifice quality for the sake of deadlines. Moreover, procrastination is a perfect killer of vital energy and productiveness that are so essential in the XXI century. The second aspect is the development of a chronic late-coming habit. How can one come somewhere on time if a person cannot plan activities? Besides, late-coming and procrastination lead to the third negative aspect. It is a daily overload that results in burnout. When nothing is well-planned, people always get busy with something, go to bed late, and cannot relax. The pressure of undone tasks prevents them from normal sleep and rest. As a result, they acquire panic attacks, anxiety, sleep disorders, apathy, or depression.
        Mindtools introduces five benefits that people face when managing their day successfully. To begin with, such people are known as productive and effective in what they do. Employers adore such individuals because they handle many tasks faster than other employees. Secondly, ideal time managers almost never feel stressed at work. They know what they have to do and how much time they require for that. Third, scheduling is the best promoter. For example, if a student has free time after having done academic homework, it will be possible to broaden one’s look. Such a student can read books to enlarge personal vocabulary, practice in report or article writing, visit different places, and meet new people for networking. All these things lead to the next benefit which is a positive reputation. Motivated individuals with perfect timing skills usually become a model for following. Finally, perfect time managers have more chances to succeed in life than time wasters. Those who control their time can control and supervise others.
